<div>
    <h3 class="text-center">Revue Privacy Policy
We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.

That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.</h3>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 class="text-center">
    Revue is public and Blogs are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world. You can also use Revue under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.

  When you use Revue, even if you’re just looking at Blogs, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you’re using and your IP address. You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile.

  In addition to information you share with us, we use your Posts, content you’ve read, Liked, and other information to determine what topics you’re interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content. We give you transparency into that information, and you can modify or correct it at any time.

  If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to hear from you. You can contact us at any time.

<h2 class="text-center">Information You Share With Us</h2>
<h4 class="text-center">We require certain information to provide our services to you. For example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content on Revue. When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.</h4>

  <h2 class="text-center">Cookies</h2>
  <h4 class="text-center">A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer7. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.

    <h2 class="text-center">Log Data</h2>
      <h4 class="text-center">
      We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Revue content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you

      <h2 class="text-center">Public Information</h2>
      <h4 class="text-center">
        Most activity on Revue is public, including your profile information, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Blogs and certain information about your Blogs like the date, time, and version of Revue you posted from. The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Blogs you Like are also public. If you like or reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Revue, are public along with when you took those actions.

You are responsible for your Blogs and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Revue, such as by deleting a post or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Revue.

By publicly posting content when you post, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Blogs to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Blogs on a news website or analyzing what people say on Revue. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free . We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Revue, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Revue.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services8; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.

        We keep Log Data for a maximum of 18 months. If you follow the instructions here (or for Periscope here), your account will be deactivated. When deactivated, your Revue account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.

        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you within Revue website or by sending an email to the email address associated with your account.
