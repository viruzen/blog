  <h2 class="text-center">Proprietary Rights in Content on Revue</h2>
  <h4 class="text-center">
    Revue does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Revue Services. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Revue Services, you hereby grant to Revue a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the Revue Services.
Some of the Revue Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Revue may place such advertising and promotions on the Revue Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Revue Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Revue Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Revue Services.
The Revue Services contain Content of Revue ("Revue Content"). Revue Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Revue owns and retains all rights in the Revue Content and the Revue Services. Revue hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Revue Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Revue Services.
The Revue Services contain Content of Users and other Revue licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Revue Services.
Revue performs technical functions necessary to offer the Revue Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Revue Services.
Although the Site and other Revue Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or other Revue Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Revue. Also, although Revue will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, Revue reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by Revue in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Revue encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Revue is not a backup service. Revue will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Revue Services, or the loss of any Content.
